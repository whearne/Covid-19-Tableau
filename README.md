# Covid-19 Dashboard ![Tableau](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tableau-E97627.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Tableau&logoColor=white)
This Tableau project provides an in-depth analysis of Covid-19 data, highlighting key statistics such as infection rates, vaccination percentages, death counts, and the virus reproduction rate. The dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of the pandemicâ€™s impact across different income levels, countries, and continents.

## Dashboard Overview
### **1. Statistics Based on Income**
- **Visualisation**: Bar charts
- **Details**: Displays Covid-19 statistics categorised by income levels (Low, Lower-middle, Upper-middle, High). It includes:
    - The percentage of the infected population who have died.
    - The percentage of the population vaccinated.
- **Insight**: Reveals how income levels may affect vaccination rates and mortality.
### 2. **Total Death Count**
- **Visualisation**: Horizontal bar chart
- **Details**: Shows the total number of Covid-19 related deaths across various countries, with the United States, Brazil, and India among the highest.
- **Insight**: Highlights the countries with the most significant loss of life, aiding in understanding the global impact.
### 3. **Deaths by Continent**
- **Visualisation**: Table
- **Details**: Summarises population figures, total death counts, and the percentage of the population that has died across different continents.
- **Insight**: Allows for a comparison of the pandemic's severity in different continents, showing variations in death rates.
### 4. **Reproduction Rate**
- **Visualisation**: Line chart
- **Details**: Plots the reproduction rate of Covid-19 over time, indicating how the virus's spread has fluctuated since March 2020.
- *Insight**: Helps to identify periods of high transmission and the effectiveness of mitigation measures.
### 5. **Percentage of Country Vaccinated**
- **Visualisation**: Map
- **Details**: A geographical map displaying the percentage of the population vaccinated in each country, with varying shades representing vaccination rates.
- **Insight**: Provides a visual comparison of global vaccination efforts.
## Key Insights
- **Income Disparities**: The dashboard highlights how income levels can influence vaccination rates and mortality, with higher-income countries generally showing higher vaccination percentages.
- **Global Impact**: The death count and reproduction rate visualisations reveal the regions and periods most affected by the pandemic.
- **Vaccination Trends**: The map and income-based statistics offer insights into global vaccination distribution, identifying regions that may need more support.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Tableau Desktop to view and interact with the dashboard.
- A Covid-19 dataset including fields such as Location, Total Death Count, Reproduction Rate, Population, Percentage Vaccinated, and Income Level.
### Installation

1. Download the Tableau workbook (Covid-19 Dashboard.twbx) from this repository.
2. Open the Tableau workbook in Tableau Desktop.
3. Connect to the provided dataset (if the data source needs to be updated).

### Usage
**Interactivity**: Use the filters and options in the dashboard to explore data by location, income level, and time period.
**Customisation**: Modify the visualisations and data sources to suit your analysis needs or include more recent data.
**Exporting**: Export the dashboard as an image, PDF, or share it on Tableau Public for easy distribution and collaboration.


## Conclusion
This dashboard serves as a versatile tool for analysing the global impact of Covid-19. It can help inform decisions on resource allocation, health policy, and vaccination efforts.
